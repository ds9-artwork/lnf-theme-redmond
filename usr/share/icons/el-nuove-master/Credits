El Nuove 1.0 by Darin

Originally a collection of different icon sets, this gtk icon pack has evolved into what is now a full theme. Any old raster-based icons from past themes were recreated to make this an entirely SVG-based icon theme. Other icons were heavily edited from the original and sourced icons, many more were completely removed and newly created from scratch. Most of the credits below still hold. I may try to update this to be more specific icon-by-icon in the future. HUGE thanks to the artists below as this set would not be possible without them! Please donate and support them!
