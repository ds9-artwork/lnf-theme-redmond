# El Nuove Icon Theme

An Icon collection I made many years ago, a recreation of NuoveXT icons as SVG with additional icons from the elementary icon theme, tango, gnome, Meliae, and Faenza (and a few poorly made original icons). This theme is pretty rough, I was just learning how icon themes worked at the time and learning how to use an SVG editor. (Inkscape!) Originally called Victory Icon Collection, I renamed it El Nuove to reflect that most of the icons here are from or edits of the Elementary icons and the NuoveXT icons.
